# Rust Number Guessing Game

## Description

This project is a direct implementation from the [Rust Programming Language Book tutorial (Chapter 2)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html). It's a simple command-line game where players guess a random number between 1 and 100.

## Attribution

This code follows the official Rust tutorial and is used as a learning exercise. All core functionality and structure are from the tutorial, with only minor modifications in code organization and added comments.

## How to Play

- Run the program
- Enter your guess when prompted
- The game will tell you if your guess is too high or too low
- Keep guessing until you find the correct number

## Technical Implementation

- Built using Rust
- Uses the `rand` crate for random number generation
- Implements error handling for invalid inputs
- Command-line interface

## What I Learned

- Basic Rust syntax and concepts
- Cargo package management
- Error handling patterns in Rust
- Working with external crates
- Basic input/output operations in Rust

## Setup and Running

1. Ensure you have Rust installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `cargo build`
4. Execute with `cargo run`
